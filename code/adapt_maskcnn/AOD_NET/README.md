# AOD-Net
This code is based on the paper: AOD-Net: All-in-One Dehazing Network. The original codes were coded by Li, Boyi, etc. 

As the original author says: AOD-Net is a light-weight but effective end-to-end dehazing neural network.

You can put the pictures you want to dehaze in the path "../data/img". After that executing "test.py". The dehazed pictures will be stored at "../data/result/"
